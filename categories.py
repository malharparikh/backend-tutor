    "overview": "The Gap Year Essay allows you to discuss the reasons behind taking a gap year and how you utilized this time to grow personally, academically, or professionally. Essay readers want to see that your gap year was a deliberate and purposeful decision that has positively impacted your readiness for college. The best essays will provide a clear rationale for the gap year, highlight specific experiences or accomplishments, and reflect on how this time has prepared you for the academic challenges ahead. Avoid simply listing activities; instead, focus on how your gap year experiences are interconnected and have contributed to your overall development.",

      "Past: Explain the impact of that gap, ideally expanding on how you’ve grown and matured and how the experiences of this year will help you get more value from your education.",
      "Past: If your gap year was used to take care of responsibilities, talk about how those responsibilities have helped you grow as a person and member of the community. Additionally, talk about others you may have affected, such as those around you who you were responsible for, and mention the positive effect you had in their lives.",
      "Past: If your gap year was used to learn or explore a passion, describe what you learned from that endeavor and how you’ve grown as an independent person and what lessons you will bring with you to college.",
      "Past: If your endeavor affected those around you, make sure to also describe the positive impact that you had on the community.",
      "If you are planning a future gap year:",
      "Future: Be ambitious! You don’t have to accomplish everything you say you want to accomplish.",
      "Future: If the decision is due to strenuous circumstances (e.g., having to take care of a family member), discuss the responsibilities that you will be taking on and how they will affect others around you.",
      "Future: Describe how you will continue to learn over the course of the year despite not being in school, despite strenuous circumstances if they exist.",
      "Future: If your gap will be used to learn or explore a passion, describe what you hope to learn and how you hope this gap will prepare you for college.",
      "Tone: Be enthusiastic about the potential but understanding of the downside.",
      "Cutting: When cutting, prioritize cutting fluff that does not answer the question. Look for small words or inefficient phrases that could be rewritten.",
      "Cross-Checking: Ensure not to reuse content that you have already used extensively in other essays. Try to expand on a new aspect of yourself.",
